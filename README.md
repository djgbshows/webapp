Portfolio project


This web app is my first portfolio project. I am building a options trading signal web application. The reason I decided to build this is because I wanted something that would challenge me, utilize almost everything I learned about javascript, css, and html, and something I would enjoy doing.



The idea is simple. Find the trendlines of a stock using a outward-in approach. 
 
Step 1. the user loads a list of stocks into the app

Step 2. the app will use the algorithm to find uptrends and if found will add them to a watchlist

Step 3. the app will sort through the watchlist to find a pullback at the opening bell, if no pullback is found then the app will automatically sort through the watchlist each day until a pullback is found

Step 4. when a pullback is found the app will print possible buy and sell limits to a table and save for the user to review
