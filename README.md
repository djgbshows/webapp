Portfolio project


This web app is my first portfolio project. I am building a options trading signal web application. The reason I decided to build this is because I wanted something that would challenge me, utilize almost everything I learned about javascript, css, and html, and something I would enjoy doing.



The idea is simple. Find the trendlines of a stock using a outward-in approach. 

Step 1. Find the trend for the monthly, weekly, and daily charts.

Step 2. Add the stock symbol that are trending to a list.

Step 3. Find the best entry and exit points for the stock.

Step 4. Print out possibly limit orders.
