 <h1>Portfolio project</h1>


<h3>This web app is my first portfolio project. I am building a options trading signal web application. The reason I decided to build this is because I wanted something that would challenge me, utilize almost everything I have learned about coding thus far, and something I would enjoy doing.</h3>
